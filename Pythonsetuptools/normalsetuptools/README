steps :
=======

    mkdir -p /tmp/try/lib/python
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/tmp/try
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/tmp/try/lib/python

    python setup.py install --home=/tmp/try


Now check if its installed by


>>> from helloworldpkg import greet
>>> h = greet.Hello().sayInenglish()
'hello'


Note if you try in new terminal the import will not work because the export has not been done globally.
so you can add the python path to /etc/profile and source it using source command

It seems there is not direct uninstall option in setup.py . It makes sense not to have it .
