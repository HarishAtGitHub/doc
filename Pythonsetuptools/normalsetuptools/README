steps :
=======

1) Install in a custom path
    mkdir -p /tmp/try/lib/python
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/tmp/try
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/tmp/try/lib/python

    python setup.py install --home=/tmp/try


Now check if its installed by


>>> from helloworldpkg import greet
>>> h = greet.Hello().sayInenglish()
'hello'

The egg file for helloworldpkg lies inside /tmp/try/lib/python
Note if you try in new terminal the import will not work because the export has not been done globally.
so you can add the python path to /etc/profile and source it using source command

It seems there is not direct uninstall option in setup.py . It makes sense not to have it .
easy way to manually remove is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1550226/python-setup-py-uninstall


2) Install in python dist-packages - (because u dont need that to be inside a custom package)
do

    python setup.py install 
    
    to unsinstall is to remove that egg file from dist-packages (/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages_
3) Install in dev mode (which is a combination of 1 and 2) don't put egg inside 
dist-packages(/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages) but the only link to the source
folder should be 
inside dist-packages(/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages)

The link file added in the dist-packages(/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages) 
will be something like helloworld.egg-link 
and this will have pointer to our location were we have the source
In short it is like building the package in same location and adding it to PYTHONPATH .

to have this
do 
    python setup.py develop
    
what is the advantage ?
  we can just modify the python files directly and see the effect without taking the pain to put it
  inside dist-packages or adding CUSTOM path to PYTHONPATH
  
  
    

Now People at openstack use pbr instead of setup tools directly :
refer: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pbr/

to remove package installed using develop 
-> remove the package from the .egg-link file in dist-packages 
-> remove the entry if any from easy-install.pth


Or do pip uninstall nameofpakcage

here do 

sudo pip uninstall helloworld

(the above command may not work for develop packages as it is virtual egg)
